			<p>Dear Future of Ethereum,</p>
			<p class="bold">We have a problem.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Ethereum staking is being <b>dominated</b> by large, single entity pools with a select few commercial node operators backing them.</li>
				<li>The community outcries against the majority of validators being held by <b>just a few pools</b>, pleading for change, and yet these large pools continue to grow.</li>
				<li>Users continue giving up their keys to pools, fully placing their assets in someone else's hands, and extending <b>huge</b> amounts of trust in someone else.</li>
				<li>The <b>technical barrier to entry is too high</b> for most people to participate in Ethereum's most foundational level.</li>
				<li>Centralization pressures are driven by large players, where choices are being made <b>for</b> users not <b>by</b> users.</li>
				<li>Ethereum node operators continue to become more <b>homogeneous</b>. Validator diversity is essential for wider adoption and value stabilization. If not addressed, Ethereum will fail to accomplish its mission as the decentralized, trustless, and permissionless network for <b>everyone</b>.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Ethereum is heading in the same direction as the systems it seeks to replace and we intend on stopping it.</p>
			<p class="bold">Today, <a href="https://verihash.io/" target="_new">VeriHash.io</a> is launching Unpool.fi!</p>
			<p>Unpool's first set of new services will enable, support, and incentivize solo staking.</p>
			<p>Unpool's mission is:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>To enable <b>anyone</b>, regardless of technical prowess, to stake for themselves in a safe, secure, and profitable manner <b>without ever giving up control of their keys</b> or their crypto.</li>
				<li>To enable staking with <b>minimal</b> user hosted hardware and bandwidth requirements whilst providing <b>institutional</b> grade connectivity to the chain.</li>
				<li>To enable <b>user choice</b> over how they wish to participate on-chain, how their blocks are built, and to whom they would like to extend trust.</li>
				<li>To enable the smallest and the largest of holders to participate on-chain and provide <b>responsible</b> liquidity options that seek to <b>enhance</b> on-chain participation.</li>
				<li>To enable <b>maximum</b> return for <b>all users</b>.</li>
				<li>To enable <b>wider adoption</b> by increasing on-chain participation diversity, providing education, and empowering the <b>user's</b> voice at the policy level.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="bold">We want a better future for Ethereum.</p>
			<p>We do not want a future with a small, well-capitalized, group of entities controlling Ethereum's destiny. We want a future where <b>everyone</b> can participate at Ethereum's most foundational level. Where <b>everyone</b> can reap the benefits without giving up control of their keys, tokens, or trust.</p>
			<p class="bold">We need your help to make a better future.</p>
			<p>We need intrepid individuals to help us achieve our mission and to take a stake in shaping Ethereum's future.</p>
			<p>We extend an invitation to:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Join our discord for further conversations and updates. Bring us your ideas, wants, or issues you are struggling with.</li>
				<li>Keep an eye out for the <b>whitepaper</b> we will be dropping soon.</li>
				<li>Tell your friends and get them engaged as well. Ethereum is what we make of it.</li>
			</ul>
			<div class="special">
				<p>A Special Note:</p>
				<p class="left">If you are presently an ETH solo staker please reach out as soon as possible. We will be on-boarding solo stakers to our platform very shortly as beta testers <b>at no charge</b> for now. We want <b>you</b> to help us build what <b>you</b> need while enhancing your current returns.</p>
			</div>
			<p>The VeriHash team is excited about the future of Unpool and we can't wait to talk about it more. Our solo staking services are just the beginning. Over the course of the next year, we will be announcing more exciting services and solutions that will widen the adoption of Ethereum.</p>
			<p>We look forward to engaging with the community, listening intently, and launching a platform that <b>truly enables anyone</b> to keep their keys, keep their crypto, and maximize their returns.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Regards,</p>
